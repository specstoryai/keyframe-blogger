_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add a "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom of the README file using the bearclaude.png icon. I need to:

1. Open the README.md file and see its current content
2. Add a "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom using the bearclaude.png icon

Since the file is already attached, I can see the current README content. I need to add the note at the end of the file.

I should use the edit_file tool to add this to the bottom of the README.md file.</details></think>

I'll add the "Made with BearClaude" note with the icon at the bottom of the README file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully added the "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom of the README file with the bearclaude.png icon. The edit was applied correctly and shows:

1. A horizontal rule (---) to separate the content
2. A centered div with the bearclaude.png image (24x24 pixels)
3. The "Made with BearClaude" text below the image

The formatting looks good and will display nicely in the README.</details></think>

Perfect! I've added the "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom of the README file using the `bearclaude.png` icon. The addition includes:

- A horizontal rule to separate it from the main content
- A centered div with the BearClaude icon (24x24 pixels)
- The "Made with BearClaude" text below the icon

The note will appear at the very bottom of the README and will be nicely formatted when viewed on GitHub or other markdown viewers.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to make the "Made with BearClaude" note link to https://bearclaude.specstory.com. I need to update the README to wrap the BearClaude text and possibly the image in a link.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've updated the README to make the "Made with BearClaude" note (both the image and text) link to https://bearclaude.specstory.com. The link wraps both the image and the text, so users can click either to visit the BearClaude website.</details></think>

include example-blog.gif in the readme at line 4

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to include "example-blog.gif" in the README at line 4. Looking at the current file, line 4 is empty according to the current_file information. Let me check what's around line 4 in the README structure:

Line 1: # Keyframe Blogger
Line 2: (empty)
Line 3: Convert instructional videos into blog posts by extracting key frames and using AI for content generation.
Line 4: (empty - this is where they want the gif)
Line 5: ## Overview

So I need to add the gif at line 4, which is currently empty, right after the description and before the Overview section.</details></think>

---

I'll add the example-blog.gif at line 4 in the README.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've added the example-blog.gif image at line 4 in the README. The image will be displayed right after the project description and before the Overview section, which is a good place to showcase what the tool does visually.</details></think>

---

Great! I've added the example-blog.gif at line 4 in the README. The GIF will now appear right after the project description and before the Overview section, providing a visual demonstration of what the Keyframe Blogger tool does.
