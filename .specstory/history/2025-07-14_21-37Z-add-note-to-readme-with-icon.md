<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add a "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom of the README file using the bearclaude.png icon. I need to:

1. Open the README.md file and see its current content
2. Add a "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom using the bearclaude.png icon

Since the file is already attached, I can see the current README content. I need to add the note at the end of the file.

I should use the edit_file tool to add this to the bottom of the README.md file.</details></think>

I'll add the "Made with BearClaude" note with the icon at the bottom of the README file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully added the "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom of the README file with the bearclaude.png icon. The edit was applied correctly and shows:

1. A horizontal rule (---) to separate the content
2. A centered div with the bearclaude.png image (24x24 pixels)
3. The "Made with BearClaude" text below the image

The formatting looks good and will display nicely in the README.</details></think>

Perfect! I've added the "Made with BearClaude" note at the bottom of the README file using the `bearclaude.png` icon. The addition includes:

- A horizontal rule to separate it from the main content
- A centered div with the BearClaude icon (24x24 pixels)
- The "Made with BearClaude" text below the icon

The note will appear at the very bottom of the README and will be nicely formatted when viewed on GitHub or other markdown viewers.
