# Brainstorm new product names (2025-07-14 20:30Z)

_**User**_

this project started out called video_transcriber but we don't actually do any transcribing anymore. it takes in the transcript as input. Brainstorm some potential new names for the product beside video_transcriber

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is looking for new names for their product since "video_transcriber" is no longer accurate. Let me understand what the product actually does based on the README:

1. Takes video + transcript (SRT) as input
2. Extracts key frames from video based on transcript analysis
3. Creates visual summaries (HTML/Markdown) with frames + transcript
4. Uses AI to generate polished blog posts from frames + transcript

So it's more about:
- Converting video content to blog posts
- Frame extraction + AI processing
- Video-to-blog workflow
- Content transformation from video to written format
- AI-powered content generation from video

Key aspects:
- Takes video + transcript as input (doesn't transcribe)
- Extracts meaningful frames
- Creates blog posts
- AI-powered
- Visual + text processing
- Content conversion/transformation

Let me brainstorm some good names that capture these aspects:</details></think>

---

Looking at your project, it's actually a sophisticated video-to-blog conversion tool that combines frame extraction with AI-powered content generation. Here are some potential names that better reflect what it actually does:

## Content Conversion Names
- `video-to-blog` - Simple, clear about the transformation
- `blog-generator` - Focuses on the end output
- `content-converter` - General transformation tool
- `video-blogger` - Combines video input with blog output

## Frame-Focused Names
- `frame-blogger` - Emphasizes the key frame extraction + blogging
- `visual-blogger` - Highlights the visual analysis aspect
- `frame-story` - Frames tell a story
- `smart-frames` - Intelligent frame selection

## AI-Powered Names
- `ai-video-blogger` - Clear about AI + video-to-blog process
- `gemini-blogger` - References the AI model you're using
- `smart-video-processor` - Emphasizes intelligent processing
- `ai-content-generator` - Broader content creation tool

## Workflow-Focused Names
- `video-workshop` - Like a workshop that transforms video
- `content-pipeline` - Emphasizes the multi-step process
- `video-processor` - General video processing tool
- `media-transformer` - Transforms media into different formats

## Creative/Brandable Names
- `frameflow` - Flow of frames into content
- `videocraft` - Crafting content from video
- `storyframes` - Frames that tell stories
- `clipcraft` - Crafting content from video clips
- `frameforge` - Forging content from frames
- `videoscribe` - Like transcribe but for the whole video-to-text process

## My Top Recommendations:
1. **`frame-blogger`** - Captures both the frame extraction and blog generation
2. **`video-to-blog`** - Simple, descriptive, SEO-friendly
3. **`frameflow`** - Brandable, suggests smooth workflow
4. **`ai-video-blogger`** - Clear about the AI-powered video-to-blog process

Which direction appeals to you? Are you looking for something more technical/descriptive or more brandable/creative?

are there any files in the project git repo itself that care what the name of the project is?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking if there are any files in the git repository that reference or depend on the project name "video_transcriber". I should search through the codebase to find any references to the current project name that would need to be updated if they change it.

Let me search for references to "video_transcriber" in the code files.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Based on my search results, it appears that there are no files in the actual project repository that hardcode or reference the project name "video_transcriber". All the references I found were in the `.specstory/history/` directory, which appears to be AI conversation/history logs and not part of the actual project code.

This is great news for the user - they can rename the project without having to update any internal references.</details></think>

Based on my search through the repository, **there are no files in the actual project code that reference or depend on the name "video_transcriber"**.

All the references I found were in the `.specstory/history/` directory, which appears to be AI conversation history logs and not part of the actual project files.

Specifically, I checked:
- âœ… **Python files** (`.py`) - No references found
- âœ… **README.md** - No references found  
- âœ… **JSON files** - No references found
- âœ… **Configuration files** (`.txt`, `.toml`, `.cfg`, `.ini`, `.yml`, `.yaml`) - No references found

This means you can safely rename the project directory and repository without needing to update any internal code references. The project name is not hardcoded anywhere in the actual functionality.

The only place you'd want to update the name is:
1. **Directory/folder name** - Just rename the folder
2. **Git repository name** - If you want to rename the repo on GitHub/GitLab
3. **README.md title** - Line 1 currently says "Video Transcriber with Frame Extraction and AI Processing"

So you're free to pick any of those new names I suggested earlier without worrying about breaking anything! ðŸŽ‰
