_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has renamed their project directory to "keyframe-blogger" and updated the GitHub repository name as well. Now they need to reconnect their local git repository with the renamed remote repository.

The typical steps for this would be:
1. Check the current remote URL
2. Update the remote URL to point to the new repository name
3. Test the connection

Let me help them with this by first checking the current git remote configuration and then updating it.</details></think>

I'll help you reconnect your local git repository with the renamed remote repository. Let me first check your current git remote configuration and then update it.

---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ✗ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:specstoryai/video_transcriber.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:specstoryai/video_transcriber.git (push)
➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ✗
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that the remote URL is still pointing to the old repository name "video_transcriber". I need to update it to point to "keyframe-blogger". I'll update the remote URL and then test the connection.</details></think>

---

I can see that your remote origin is still pointing to the old repository name `video_transcriber`. Let me update it to point to the new `keyframe-blogger` repository:

---

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:specstoryai/keyframe-blogger.git
```

```
?➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ?✗git remote set-url origin git@github.com:specstoryai/keyframe-blogger.gitt
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I notice the command output looks a bit garbled - there seems to be some formatting issues and an extra 't' at the end. Let me verify the remote URL was set correctly and test the connection.</details></think>

---

Now let me verify that the remote URL was updated correctly and test the connection:

---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
?➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ?✗ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:specstoryai/keyframe-blogger.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:specstoryai/keyframe-blogger.git (push)
➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ✗
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The remote URL has been updated correctly to point to the new repository name. Now let me test the connection to make sure everything is working properly.</details></think>

---

Perfect! The remote URL has been updated correctly. Now let me test the connection to make sure everything is working:

---

```bash
git fetch origin
```

```
➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ✗ git fetch origin
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Excellent! The `git fetch origin` command completed successfully without any errors, which means the connection to the renamed remote repository is working properly. Let me also check the status to make sure everything looks good.</details></think>

---

Excellent! Your git repository is now successfully connected to the renamed remote repository. Let me also check the current status:

---

```bash
git status
```

```
?➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ?✗ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .specstory/history/2025-07-14_20-30Z-brainstorm-new-product-names.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ✗
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Everything looks good. The git status shows that the branch is up to date with 'origin/main', which confirms that the local repository is properly connected to the renamed remote repository on GitHub.

Let me summarize what I've done for the user.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Your local git repository is now successfully connected to the renamed remote repository. Here's what I did:

✅ **Updated the remote URL**: Changed from `git@github.com:specstoryai/video_transcriber.git` to `git@github.com:specstoryai/keyframe-blogger.git`

✅ **Verified the connection**: The `git fetch origin` command completed successfully, confirming the connection works

✅ **Confirmed sync status**: Your branch is up to date with `origin/main`

Your git setup is now properly configured with the new repository name. You can continue with normal git operations like `git push`, `git pull`, etc., and they'll work with the renamed repository on GitHub.

The only thing showing in your git status is an untracked file (`.specstory/history/2025-07-14_20-30Z-brainstorm-new-product-names.md`), which is unrelated to the repository rename.
