we renamed this project from video_transcriber to keyframe-blogger to better reflect what it's actually doing now. Make some minor updates to @README.md to reflect this

_**User**_

Ok, great. I've done a little updating and reorganizing of this project. checkout @README.md and tell me what's new

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Looking at the updated README, here are the key changes:

1. **Poetry for dependency management** - Switched from pip/venv to Poetry for better dependency management and reproducibility

2. **Visual enhancements**:
   - Added an animated GIF demo at the top (`media/example-blog.gif`)
   - Added a screenshot of the visual transcript (`media/full_transcript_with_visual_markers.png`)
   - Moved the BearClaude logo to a `media/` folder

3. **Script reorganization** - All scripts now use `poetry run` prefix and appear to be in a `scripts/` directory

4. **Improved documentation**:
   - Added a note about converting other transcript formats (VTT, TXT) to SRT
   - The BearClaude attribution now links to `https://bearclaude.specstory.com`

5. **Better project structure** - Images and media files are now organized in a dedicated `media/` folder

The project maintains all the functionality but with improved organization and visual documentation.

```
Here's a concise guide to the Google Gen AI Python SDK:

Installation:
\```
pip install google-genai
\```

Authentication:
1. For Gemini Developer API:
\```python
client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY')
\```

2. Environment variable option:
\```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
\```

Generating Content with Text and Images:
\```python
# Text generation
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-001', 
    contents='Why is the sky blue?'
)

# Image and text generation
file = client.files.upload(file='image.jpg')
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-001',
    contents=['What is in this image?', file]
)
\```

Key Features:
- Supports both Gemini Developer API and Vertex AI
- Flexible content generation with text, images, and function calls
- Configurable generation parameters like temperature and max tokens

Note: This is a new SDK, so users migrating from previous libraries should carefully review the documentation for changes in method signatures and usage.

- Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
- No more GCP project setup or gcloud authentication needed!

why did you get rid of all the Part.from_text calls?

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

You're right to question that. The new `google-genai` library might still use a similar Part-based structure for handling mixed content (text and images). Let me check the documentation more carefully to see the correct way to structure content with this library.

Based on the search results, I can provide information about the Google GenAI Python library's `Part.from_text` method and how it handles mixed content with images.

## Google GenAI Python Library - Part.from_text and Mixed Content

The Google GenAI Python library (google-genai) is a Python client library for interacting with Google's Generative AI APIs. It supports the Gemini Developer API and Vertex AI APIs.

### Creating Mixed Content with Text and Images

The library provides several ways to create mixed content:

1. **Part.from_text for Text Content**:
   The SDK converts all non function call parts into a content with a user role. You can create text parts using `types.Part.from_text()`.

2. **Part.from_uri for Cloud Storage Images**:
   \```python
   contents = types.Part.from_uri(
       file_uri: 'gs://generativeai-downloads/images/scones.jpg',
       mime_type: 'image/jpeg',
   )
   \```

3. **Part.from_bytes for Inline Images**:
   types.Part.from_bytes(
       data=image_bytes,
       mime_type='image/jpeg',
   )

### Example of Mixed Content Generation

Here's how to use mixed text and image content:

\```python
from google import genai
import PIL.Image
client = genai.Client()
organ = PIL.Image.open(media / "organ.jpg")
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents=["Tell me about this instrument", organ]
)
print(response.text)
\```

### Multiple Images with Text

The library also supports multiple images in a single request:

\```python
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=[
        "What is different between these two images?",
        uploaded_file,  # Use the uploaded file reference
        types.Part.from_bytes(
            data=img2_bytes,
            mime_type='image/png'
        )
    ]
)
\```

### Key Points

- These can be a mix of inline data (local files or URLs) and File API references
- The library automatically handles different content types (text, images, audio) when creating requests
- You can mix text strings with image objects directly in the contents list
- The Gemini API supports content generation with images, audio, code, tools, and more

The `Part.from_text` method is used specifically for text content, while images should be handled either through direct PIL Image objects, `Part.from_bytes()` for inline data, or `Part.from_uri()` for cloud storage references.
```

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Now let me check the actual google-genai documentation to understand the correct API:

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Tool use: **WebFetch**

Result:

```
Based on the documentation, here's how to work with Part objects and mixed content:

1. Importing:
\```python
from google.genai import types
\```

2. Creating Part objects:
- Text: `types.Part.from_text(text='Why is the sky blue?')`
- Bytes (local image): 
\```python
with open(YOUR_IMAGE_PATH, 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()
types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_bytes, mime_type=YOUR_IMAGE_MIME_TYPE)
\```
- URI (cloud storage image): 
\```python
types.Part.from_uri(
    file_uri='gs://generativeai-downloads/images/scones.jpg', 
    mime_type='image/jpeg'
)
\```

3. Mixed content example:
\```python
contents = [
    types.Part.from_text('What is this image about?'),
    types.Part.from_uri(
        file_uri='gs://generativeai-downloads/images/scones.jpg',
        mime_type='image/jpeg'
    )
]
\```

The SDK will automatically convert these mixed parts into a single user content with multiple parts.
```

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Now I understand! I need to update the code to properly use `types.Part` from the google-genai library. Let me fix the process_with_ai.py script:

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

I've restored the proper Part-based structure using `types.Part.from_text()` for text content and `types.Part.from_bytes()` for images. The key differences from the original Vertex AI code:

1. Import `types` from `google.genai`
2. Use `types.Part.from_text()` instead of `Part.from_text()`
3. Use `types.Part.from_bytes()` for images instead of `Part.from_data()`
4. Simplified the model handling since google-genai uses standard model names
5. Removed the complex file upload logic since we can pass bytes directly

The structure now properly uses the google-genai library's Part objects for mixed text and image content.

_**User**_

did you read this? https://gemini-api.apidog.io/doc-965860
Upload an image file
You can use the Files API to upload an image file. Always use the Files API when the total request size (including the file, text prompt, system instructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB, or if you intend to use the same image in multiple prompts.

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

You're absolutely right! I should be using the Files API for uploading images, especially since we're dealing with multiple frame images that could easily exceed 20 MB total. Let me update the code to use the proper file upload approach:

```

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Now the code properly uses the Files API to upload images before sending them to Gemini. The key improvements:

1. **Files API Upload**: Each image is uploaded using `client.files.upload(path=...)` before being sent to the model
2. **Proper handling of large requests**: Since we're uploading potentially many frame images, using the Files API ensures we don't hit size limits
3. **Cleanup**: After generating the blog post, we delete the uploaded files to avoid cluttering the user's file storage
4. **Mixed content handling**: The code now properly handles both Part objects (for text) and file paths (for images to upload)

This approach is more efficient and follows Google's recommendation for handling images, especially when dealing with multiple images or large file sizes.

help me 
The current project's supported Python range (>=3.8,<4.0) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
  - google-genai requires Python >=3.9, so it will not be installable for Python >=3.8,<3.9

Because no versions of google-genai match >1.25.0,<2.0.0
 and google-genai (1.25.0) requires Python >=3.9, google-genai is forbidden.
So, because keyframe-blogger depends on google-genai (^1.25.0), version solving failed.

  * Check your dependencies Python requirement: The Python requirement can be specified via the `python` or `markers` properties

    For google-genai, a possible solution would be to set the `python` property to ">=3.9,<4.0"

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Done! I've updated both the pyproject.toml and README.md to require Python 3.9+ which is compatible with the google-genai library. You should now be able to run `poetry install` successfully.

Installing the current project: keyframe-blogger (0.1.0)
Error: The current project could not be installed: No file/folder found for package keyframe-blogger
If you do not want to install the current project use --no-root.
If you want to use Poetry only for dependency management but not for packaging, you can disable package mode by setting package-mode = false in your pyproject.toml file.
If you did intend to install the current project, you may need to set `packages` in your pyproject.toml file.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Poetry is trying to install the current project as a package but can't find the package structure. Since this is a collection of scripts rather than a library, let's update the pyproject.toml to disable package mode:

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Now when you run `poetry install`, it will only install the dependencies without trying to install the project itself as a package. This is perfect for a scripts-based project like this one.

---

_**User**_

following the readme next, this happens ➜  keyframe-blogger git:(main) ✗ poetry shell

Looks like you're trying to use a Poetry command that is not available.

Since Poetry (2.0.0), the shell command is not installed by default. You can use,

  - the new env activate command (recommended); or
  - the shell plugin to install the shell command

Documentation: https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#activating-the-environment

Note that the env activate command is not a direct replacement for shell command.

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Poetry 2.0 changed how environment activation works. Let's update the README to reflect the new recommended approach:

```

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

The README now shows both options. Since all the command examples in the README already use `poetry run`, users can simply skip the activation step and run commands directly with the `poetry run` prefix.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

The error indicates that `Part.from_text()` is being called incorrectly. Let me check the google-genai documentation to see the correct syntax:

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Tool use: **WebFetch**

Result:

```
Based on the documentation, `types.Part.from_text()` takes a keyword argument `text`. Here are two examples from the document:

1. Simple text part:
\```python
types.Part.from_text(text='Why is the sky blue?')
\```

2. In a generate_content context:
\```python
contents = types.Part.from_text(text='Why is the sky blue?')
\```

The documentation consistently shows `text` as a keyword argument when creating text parts using `from_text()`.
```

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

I see the issue. The `from_text()` method requires a keyword argument `text=` rather than a positional argument. Let me fix this:

will Poetry let me set an environment variable like GEMINI_API_KEY through an .env file?

Yes, but Poetry itself doesn't automatically load .env files. You have a few options:

2. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key` to it
3. The script will automatically load it when run

The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` so it won't be accidentally committed to version control.

I need to check the correct API for the google-genai library. Let me fix these issues:

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Tool use: **WebFetch**

Result:

```
Based on the documentation:

1. File Upload:
The correct parameter is `file`, not 'path'. Example:
\```python
file1 = client.files.upload(file='2312.11805v3.pdf')
\```

2. Generation Parameters:
Use `types.GenerateContentConfig` with parameters like temperature, top_p, and max_output_tokens:
\```python
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-001',
    contents='Why is the sky blue?',
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        temperature=0.3,
        top_p=0.95,
        max_output_tokens=100
    )
)
\```

The documentation provides a clear example showing how to configure these generation parameters using the `GenerateContentConfig` class from the `types` module.
```

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

Now let me fix the code with the correct API:

ok. this works, but takes a long time for file uploads and deletes. Before, we were using vertex-ai and the Part.from_data approach to base64 encode the images directly into the request. This worked fine and didn't trip the request limit, perhaps because of compression. From the docs for https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai we can probably do the same thing using this library. 
If your image is stored in your local file system, you can read it in as bytes data and use the from_bytes class method to create a Part object.

from google.genai import types

YOUR_IMAGE_PATH = 'your_image_path'
YOUR_IMAGE_MIME_TYPE = 'your_image_mime_type'
with open(YOUR_IMAGE_PATH, 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

for chunk in client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-001',
    contents=[
        'What is this image about?',
        types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_bytes, mime_type=YOUR_IMAGE_MIME_TYPE),
    ],
):
    print(chunk.text, end='')

in our real world example, we don't seem to be tripping the total request size limit and the response comes much faster. So let's switch in inlining our images

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-20250514)**_

You're absolutely right! Let's switch back to inline image encoding using `Part.from_bytes()` which is much faster and avoids the file upload/delete overhead:
